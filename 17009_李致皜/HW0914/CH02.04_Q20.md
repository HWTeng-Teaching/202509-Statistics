### 20. Mercury Concentration in Dolphins Scientists are increasingly concerned with the buildup of toxic elements in marine mammals and the transfer of these elements to the animals’ offspring. The striped dolphin was the subject of one such study. The mercury concentrations (micrograms/ gram) in the livers of 28 male striped dolphins were as follows:
1.70  183.00  221.00  286.00

1.72  168.00  406.00  315.00

8.80  218.00  252.00  241.00

5.90  180.00  329.00  397.00

101.00  264.00  316.00  209.00

85.40  481.00  445.00  314.00

118.00  485.00  278.00  318.00


#### a. Calculate the five-number summary for the data.
- Min = 1.70
- Q1  = 155.50
- Median = 246.50
- Q3  = 316.50
- Max = 485.00

#### b. Draw a box plot for the data.

#### c. Are there any outliers?
- IQR = Q3 – Q1 = 315.00 – 85.40 = **161.0**  
- Lower fence = Q1 – 1.5×IQR = 85.40 – 344.40 = **–86.00**  
- Upper fence = Q3 + 1.5×IQR = 315.00 + 344.40 = **558.00**
- 所有數值皆在-86.00 to 659.40之間,因此無離群值

#### d. If you knew that the first four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, while all the others were more than 8 years old, would this information help explain the difference in the size of those four observations? Explain.
- 若前四個數值是屬於三歲以下的海豚,不考慮有其他控制變因的情況下,就從數據來說,年紀在三歲以下有極低的數值,而其他是八歲以上,由此推測會受到年紀會影響到進食與環境暴露的長短.
