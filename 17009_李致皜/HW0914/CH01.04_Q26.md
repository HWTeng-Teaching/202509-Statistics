### 26. Preschool The ages (in months) at which 50 children were first enrolled in a preschool are listed as follows.
38 40 30 35 39 40 48 36 31 36
47 35 34 43 41 36 41 43 48 40
32 34 41 30 46 35 40 30 46 37
55 39 33 32 32 45 42 41 36 50
42 50 37 39 33 45 38 46 36 31

#### a. Construct a relative frequency histogram for the sedata. Start the lower boundary of the first class at 30 and use a class width of 5 months.

#### b. What proportion of the children were 35 months or older, but less than 45 months of age when first enrolled in preschool?
filterdata = [age for age in age_data if 35 <= age < 45]

len(filterdata) / len(age_data)

0.54

#### c. If one child were selected at random from this group of children, what is the probability that the child was less than 50 months old when first enrolled in preschool?

ages_less50 = [age for age in age_data if age < 50]

num_less50 = len(ages_less_than_50)

totalobject = len(age_data)

num_less50 / totalobject

0.94
