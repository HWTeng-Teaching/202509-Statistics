### z-Scores For the data sets in Exercises 1–3, find the mean, the standard deviation, and the z-scores corresponding to the minimum and maximum in the data set. Do the z-scores indicate that there are possible outliers in these data sets?
2. n511 measurements: 2.3, 1.0, 2.1, 6.5, 2.8, 7.8, 1.7, 2.9, 4.4, 5.1, 2.0


- Minimum = **1.0**  
- Maximum = **7.8**
- Mean = **3.51**
- Sample standard deviation = **2.16**
- z-score minimum = ${  z_{\min} = \dfrac{1.0 - 3.51}{2.16} = \mathbf{-1.16} }$
- z-score maximum = ${  z_{\max} = \dfrac{7.8 - 3.51}{2.16} = \mathbf{1.98} }$

-  (|z| ≥ 3)為顯著, z-score min -1.16 和 max 1.98 均小於該數字,因此無顯著的偏離值.
