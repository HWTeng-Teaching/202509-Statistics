# Mercury Concentration in Dolphins - Statistical Analysis

## Problem Statement
Scientists are studying the buildup of toxic elements in marine mammals and their transfer to offspring. This analysis examines mercury concentrations (micrograms/gram) in the livers of 28 male striped dolphins.

### Tasks:
a. Calculate the five-number summary for the data
b. Draw a box plot for the data  
c. Identify any outliers
d. Analyze the relationship between age and mercury concentration

## Dataset
**Mercury concentrations (μg/g) in 28 male striped dolphins:**

```
1.70    183.00   221.00   286.00
1.72    168.00   406.00   315.00
8.80    218.00   252.00   241.00
5.90    180.00   329.00   397.00
101.00  264.00   316.00   209.00
85.40   481.00   445.00   314.00
118.00  485.00   278.00   318.00
```

**Age Information:**
- First 4 dolphins: < 3 years old
- Remaining 24 dolphins: > 8 years old

## Solution

### a. Five-Number Summary

**Sorted Data:**
```
1.70, 1.72, 5.90, 8.80, 85.40, 101.00, 118.00, 168.00, 180.00, 183.00, 
209.00, 218.00, 221.00, 241.00, 252.00, 264.00, 278.00, 286.00, 314.00, 
315.00, 316.00, 318.00, 329.00, 397.00, 406.00, 445.00, 481.00, 485.00
```

**Five-Number Summary:**

| Statistic | Value | Position |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Minimum** | 1.70 | 1st value |
| **Q1 (First Quartile)** | 126.50 | Between 7th and 8th values |
| **Q2 (Median)** | 258.00 | Between 14th and 15th values |
| **Q3 (Third Quartile)** | 317.00 | Between 21st and 22nd values |
| **Maximum** | 485.00 | 28th value |

**Calculations:**
- Q1 position: (28 + 1) × 0.25 = 7.25 → Q1 = 118.00 + 0.25(168.00 - 118.00) = 126.50
- Q2 position: (28 + 1) × 0.50 = 14.5 → Q2 = 241.00 + 0.5(252.00 - 241.00) = 258.00
- Q3 position: (28 + 1) × 0.75 = 21.75 → Q3 = 316.00 + 0.75(318.00 - 316.00) = 317.00

### b. Box Plot Description

The box plot would show:
- **Box**: From Q1 (126.50) to Q3 (317.00)
- **Median line**: At 258.00
- **Lower whisker**: From Q1 to minimum (1.70)
- **Upper whisker**: From Q3 to maximum (485.00)
- **Outliers**: Any points beyond 1.5 × IQR from the quartiles

### c. Outlier Analysis

**Interquartile Range (IQR):**
```
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 317.00 - 126.50 = 190.50
```

**Outlier Boundaries:**
```
Lower fence = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR = 126.50 - 1.5 × 190.50 = 126.50 - 285.75 = -159.25
Upper fence = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR = 317.00 + 1.5 × 190.50 = 317.00 + 285.75 = 602.75
```

**Outlier Identification:**
- **Lower outliers**: None (all values > -159.25)
- **Upper outliers**: None (all values < 602.75)
- **Conclusion**: No statistical outliers detected using the 1.5 × IQR rule

### d. Age and Mercury Concentration Relationship

**Young Dolphins (< 3 years old):**
- Values: 1.70, 1.72, 8.80, 5.90
- Mean: 4.53 μg/g
- Range: 1.70 - 8.80 μg/g

**Adult Dolphins (> 8 years old):**
- Remaining 24 values
- Mean: 285.71 μg/g (approximate)
- Range: 85.40 - 485.00 μg/g

**Analysis:**
Yes, the age information strongly explains the difference in mercury concentrations. The four youngest dolphins show dramatically lower mercury concentrations compared to the adult dolphins. This pattern suggests:

1. **Bioaccumulation over time**: Mercury accumulates in dolphin tissues as they age
2. **Environmental exposure duration**: Older dolphins have had longer exposure to mercury contamination
3. **Dietary factors**: Adult dolphins may consume prey with higher mercury concentrations
4. **Metabolic differences**: Young dolphins may have different mercury processing capabilities

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Young dolphins: All values ≤ 8.80 μg/g
- Adult dolphins: All values ≥ 85.40 μg/g
- Clear separation with no overlap between age groups
- Adult dolphins show approximately 63× higher average mercury concentration

This age-related pattern is consistent with mercury bioaccumulation research in marine mammals, where concentrations typically increase with age due to continuous exposure and slow elimination rates.

## Summary Statistics

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Sample Size (n) | 28 |
| Mean | 238.58 μg/g |
| Median | 258.00 μg/g |
| Standard Deviation | 161.85 μg/g |
| Range | 483.30 μg/g |
| Coefficient of Variation | 67.9% |

The high coefficient of variation (67.9%) indicates substantial variability in mercury concentrations, which is largely explained by the age factor.
