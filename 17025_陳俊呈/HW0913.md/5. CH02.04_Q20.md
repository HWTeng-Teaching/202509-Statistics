|25|406.00|
|26|445.00|
|27|481.00|
|28|485.00|

Popsition of Q1: $0.25 \times (28+1) = 7.25$<br>
Position of Q3: $0.75 \times (28+1)	= 21.75$<br>
Position of Median: $0.5 \times (28+1) = 14.50$<br>


## a.<br>
|Item|Data|
|---|---|
|Min|	1.70|
|Q1|	=118.00 + ( $0.25 \times (168.00-118.00)$ ) = 130.50|
|Median|	=241.00+ ( $0.5 \times (252.00-241.00)$ ) = 246.50|
|Q3|=316+ ( $0.75 \times (318.00-316.00)$ ) =	317.50|
|Max|	485.00|

## c.<br>

|Item|Data|
|---|---|
|IQR|	=317.50-130.50=187.00 |
|Lower fence|	=130.50-( $1.5 \times 187$ ) = -150.00|
|Upper fence|	=317.50+( $1.5 \times 187$ ) = 598.00|
<br>
No outliers

## d.<br>
Yes<br>
If the four dolphins were all less than 3 years old, which is around 14% in these total 28 dolphins.<br>
For the dataset with 28 data, there are only four data that lower than 10 (micrograms/gram), which is also around 14% in this dataset and match the portion of four dolphins less than 3 years.<br>
Therefore, this information can help to explain that the four dolphins probably match the four data that lower than 10 (micrograms/gram) as the offspring.<br>
