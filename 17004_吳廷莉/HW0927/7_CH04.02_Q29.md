### b. The table on the next page shows the distribution of the 25 students according to gender and preschool experience. Use the table to assign probabilities to the simple events in part a.
Female=11

Female(P)=11/25=44%

Female&Preschool(P)=9/25=36%

Female&No Preschool(P)=2/25=8%

Male=14  

Male(P)=14/25=56%

Male&Preschool(P)=8/25=32%

Male&No Preschool(P)=6/25=24%
