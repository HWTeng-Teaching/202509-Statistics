**B: Proportion of Children 35 to Less than 45 Months Old** 

Frequency for 35-39 months: 14 children  

Frequency for 40-44 months: 12 children  

The total number of children in this range is 14+12=26.

The proportion is the number of children in this range divided by the total number of children (50).
Proportion = 26/50=0.52.

The proportion of children who were 35 months or older but less than 45 months of age is 0.52, or 52%.

**C: Probability of Being Less Than 50 Months Old**

Number of children less than 50 months old = (Children in 30-34 months class) + (Children in 35-39 months class) + (Children in 40-44 months class) + (Children in 45-49 months class)

Number = 12+14+12+8=46

The total number of children is 50.

The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (children less than 50 months old) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all children).

Probability = 46/50=0.92.

The probability that a randomly selected child was less than 50 months old is 0.92, or 92%.
