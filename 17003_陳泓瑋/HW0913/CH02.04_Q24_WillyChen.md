**b. What does the box plot tell you about the distribution of utility costs for this household?**  
A box plot gives us some key insights into the distribution of the utility costs:

Spread: The data has a wide range, from a low of about $234 to a high of about $459. This indicates a significant variation in spending across the different months.

Skewness: The median line is located closer to the bottom of the box ($Q_1$
​
 ), and the upper part of the box (from the median to $Q_3$
​
 ) is much wider than the lower part. This suggests that the data distribution is right-skewed, meaning most months have lower bills, while a few months have much higher bills (likely during peak seasons like summer or winter).

Interquartile Range (IQR): The length of the box shows the spread of the middle 50% of the data. In this case, the IQR is fairly wide, indicating that even the bills in the central range of the data have a good amount of variability.
