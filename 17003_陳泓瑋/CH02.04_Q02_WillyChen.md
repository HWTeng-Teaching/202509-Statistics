The mean (x_bar) is: 3.51  
The standard deviation (s) is: 2.16

Minimum value: 1.0  
Z-score for minimum: -1.16

Maximum value: 7.8  
Z-score for maximum: 1.98

--- Outlier Analysis ---  
Based on the z-scores, there are no apparent outliers.

The formula for a z-score is $z=\frac{x−\bar{x}}{8}$

Minimum Value: The minimum value in the data set is 1.0.

$z_{min}=\frac{1.0−3.51}{2.053}≈−1.22$

Maximum Value: The maximum value in the data set is 7.8.

$z_{max}=\frac{7.8−3.51}{2.053}≈2.09$

**4. Are there possible outliers?**
A common rule of thumb for identifying outliers is if a z-score is greater than +3 or less than −3. Both of our calculated z-scores (−1.22 and 2.09) are well within this range. Therefore, based on the z-scores, there are no apparent outliers in this data set.
